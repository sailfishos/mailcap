Description: |
    The mailcap file is used by the metamail program.  Metamail reads the
    mailcap file to determine how it should display non-text or multimedia
    material.  Basically, mailcap associates a particular type of file
    with a particular program that a mail agent or other program can call
    in order to handle the file.
    
    Mailcap should be installed to allow certain programs to be able to
    handle non-text files.
